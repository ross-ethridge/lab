description: Who I am, what I write, and how this site is built.
---

Hi, I’m Ross. I write about building fast, secure, low‑maintenance sites and apps—especially with serverless tools.

What you’ll find here
- Architecture tips, performance tweaks, and cost-saving strategies
- Occasional opinions, experiments, and code snippets
- Music
- Opinions about life

How this site is built
- Jekyll turns Markdown into static pages.
- Cloudflare Pages serves the site globally and runs small Functions when needed.
- R2 stores large assets and downloadable files (optional).
- The whole thing is versioned in Git. Deploys are a ZIP upload or CI push.

Colophon and privacy
- No servers to patch, no traditional databases to harden—most pages are static.
- Minimal or no tracking. If analytics are enabled, they’re privacy‑respecting and aggregated.
- Images are optimized; pages aim for accessibility and fast loads.

Licensing
- Unless noted otherwise, code samples are MIT; writing is CC BY 4.0. Feel free to share with attribution.

PS: If you spot a typo or have a suggestion, open an issue or PR on GitHub, or send me a note.
